      <p class="lead mx-2">Hello,</p>
      <p class="lead mx-2">My name is Diana Sanderson. I am currently a Notice Processing Officer with
        Sheffield
        City Council. I process applications, log/process reports relating to parking, Enforcement as well as Events as

        ever-changing role I am regularly exposed to new systems, process and guidelines. I am required to research,
        adapt and learn new skills to fulfill my duties. I also interpret maps, plans and Traffic orders for the
        purposes of
        answering inquiries in relation to
        parking matters over the phone to the public, businesses and all citizens of Sheffield as well as other counties

        <h1>Soft Skills</h1>
        <img class="mx-auto d-block pt-5" src="softSkill.png" alt="list of soft skills">

        <h3>Collaboration: </h3>
        <p>Throughout my career I have worked along side others, we all thrive in a social situation given opportunity.I
          have been very fortunate to <b>cultivate good relationships</b> and be surrounded
          with like minded people. There
          have been times that required me to think on my feet and put myself in their peoples shoes. I strongly believe
          open communication and a clear goal are predictors of success.</p>
        <h3>Attention to detail:</h3>
        <p>For most of my career I have worked with sensitive information regarding members of the public. My actions
          could have had direct implications on the lives of others and I am <b>extremely focused and careful in
            protecting
            information</b> when completing my duties.</p>
        <h3>Problem solving</h3>
        <p>I am <b>proactive</b> and adopt a problem solving approach to work and all areas in life. I believe this is
          evident
          in the service areas I have worked in. For example; when managing public inquries I would treat
          each situation on its own merit - focusing on the individuals need and what we as a public service can do,
          always focused on solving the siuation where both parties are satisfied. I try to <b>break down</b> the
          situation and
          <b>focus on each part</b>, resoloving them when I can, always aiming for an amicable decision on what action
          needs to
          be taken.</p>
        <h3>Drive</h3>
        <p>I have the <b>determination</b> to work harder than most and make sure things get done. I pride
          myself on going the extra mile. I drive myself with purpose and
          align myslef with excellence. This is evident with my determination to learn programming as well as <b>excel
            in</b>
          my abilitiles to connect and communicate at a high level which as earned me Customer Service advisor of the
          month on serveral occasions.
          <h3>Self-reliance</h3>
          <p>I can shoulder <b>responsibilities and be accountable</b>. I can make hard decisions and
            stand by them. To think for myslef and know what I am capable of but also to recognize that failure is
            really an opportunity to learn.</p>
          <h3>Willpower</h3>
          <p>I have the <b>strength to see things through</b>. When I want to achieve something, I will
            work
            to
            make it happen. I have stayed focused on my goals to achieve Customer Service adivosr of the month as well
            as my hard work to progress within the council.I am consistent in my efforts to progress further in life
            and to achieve my dreams.</p>
          <p>No one plans on being mediocre; mediocrity happens when you don't plan. If I want to succeed, I learn
            the
            traits from the succesful before me like Les Brown, Ada lovelace, Elon Musk, Oprah Winfrey, Gary Vee
            and
            Tony robbins to name a few and plan on living with the focus and determination they inspire, every
            day.
          </p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-6 pt-5">
        <div class="row mx-1">

          <h3>Communication:</h3>
          <p> I have developed <b>excellent communication skills </b> through almost a decade of teaching as well as
            through my
            customer service roles. I am also a <b>confident presenter</b> and have been in children's entertainment
            from a
            young age.</p>
          <p>About 15 years ago I picked up a book about human behaviour, since then I have read books by
            Eckman, Bono and many others, I developed a keen interest in human behaviour since then I have utilized the
            information to enhance my interactions with people from all walks of life from varying my ways of
            communication, to adapting to an individual’s speech, tone and vocabulary and to be able to adapt and and
            remain positive and tenacious.</p>
          <h3>Time management:</h3>
          <p>I currently work on a <b>strict</b> call/job schedule and have to <b>monitor</b> my every interaction to
            make sure I hit
            the goals set by the wider organisation. Additionally, I have invested a considerable amount of time into
            developing my coding skills to no detriment to my full time job or my family.</p>
          <p>This is evident by my <b>commitment</b> to daily course work from 4.30am to 6.30am, then getting ready and
            heading
            off to my full time position with Sheffield City council, returning home to spend time with the family and
            maintaining regular rest to fulfill my current duties. This is now a routine I follow and has been for the
            last
            3 years.</p>
          <p>I feel If I didn’t manage my time, I wouldn’t be able to
            achieve what I do on a daily basis. I also have three children so I manage their schedules between home, the
            child minders, school, after
            school clubs and the grandparents; they all have a weekly schedule list which covers PE days, Music Classes,
            After school Clubs, Performance practices & rehearsals, Test days, Revision days, Game days, dinner at
            friends/ grandparents, who needs picking up and when, chores, fun days, film night and a chore rota.</p>
          <p>I understand to achieve what we want in life is hard and requires commitment and follow through even on
            days when I dont feel up to it. </p>
          <h3>Patience</h3>
          <p>I am able to be patient, and to understand that, in everything, there are
            failures
            and frustrations.
            To take them personally would be a detriment.They are after all learning opportunities</p>
          <h3>Integrity</h3>
          <p>This should not have to be said, but it's seriously one of the <b>most important
              attributes</b> I cultivate.
            Honesty is the best policy for everything I do; integrity creates character and defines who I am and who I
            choose to be.
          </p>
          <p>I have no problem admitting when I am wrong or if I dont know something. As a customer advisor I felt this
            is what connected with people and made a lot of my feedback, positive . I may not know something but that
            will not stop me from learning or
            finding out.</p>
          <h3>Passion</h3>
          <p>If I want <b>to succeed</b>, if I want to live the life I dream of, it is
            passion that will get me there. Life is 10 percent what you experience and 90 percent how you respond
            to
            it. Although I may be my harshest critique I am also my best teacher.
          </p>
          <p>I am a passion learner, hungry for knowledge. I have a positive attitude towards learning and improving and
            am committed to demonstrating this on a daily basis as is evident in the long list of courses I have
            undertaken and projects I have created using the knowledge, learnt. </p>
          <h3>Optimism</h3>
          <p>I know there is much to achieve and much good in the world, and I know what's worth
            fighting for. Optimism is a strategy for making a better future ~ I am always ready to <b>step up and take
              responsibility</b> for making it so.</p>
          <h3>Self-confidence</h3>
          <p>I trust myself and because I do, that <b>unshakeable trust
              in
              myself and my capabilities</b> ~ I'm already one step closer to achieve my dreams and fulfilling my
            passions.
